Goals of the Assignment:

1. Use command line that accepts user input
2. Prompt user for information about app repository 
    Information includes a title of the project, sections for description, table of contents, installation, usage, license, contributing tests, and questions
3. Input title should be the name of the readme
4. Input for all of the sections listed above should mirror on the generated readme
5. The license should be a list of options, and the badge for that license is added at the top of the readme with the license section being updated to explain which license the application is covered for 
6. Prompt should ask for github username, which updates part of the questions section with a link to the github profile 
7. Prompt for email address which is added to the questions section with instructions on how to reach me
8. Table of Contents should be clickable to move to the corresponding section of the readme

This was accomplished by: 
1. Using Inquirer NPM to allow user input
2. User is prompted for all of the information required by the assignment.
3. All inputs are put in their corresponding sections, and the title is set as the name of the README
4. A license list is given as a list option, and the user is able to select the one that they want. The image of the license is then put at the top of the README
5. Github username and email are put in the Question tab, and are fully functional
6. Table of contents is interactive and allows the user to click to bring them to different sections
