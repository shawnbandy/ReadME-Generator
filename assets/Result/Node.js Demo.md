### Description
This is an example of using node.js to generate a readme using the index.js file in this repository. The application in the terminal asks a series of questions to the user, and automatically puts the answers into the readme in the corresponding place. The application asks for title, description, installation instructions, usage information, a license, contribution guidelines, test instructions, and contact information. Then, the console displays the user's answers, and gives a success message when the readme is generated.
